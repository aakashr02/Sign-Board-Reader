### Necesaary Libraries
1. OpenCV: OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision) is a popular opensource computer vision library used for processing images and videos. It 
provides a range of algorithms for tasks such as image processing, feature 
detection, object recognition, and more. OpenCV is widely used in fields 
such as robotics, augmented reality, and image processing.
2. Pytesseract: Pytesseract is an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) engine 
based on Google's Tesseract OCR engine. It is a Python wrapper that allows 
developers to use Tesseract OCR in their Python applications. Pytesseract is 
used to recognize text in images and convert it into machine-readable text 
format.
3. Googletrans: Googletrans is a Python library for translating text using the 
Google Translate API. It provides a simple and easy-to-use interface for 
translating text between different languages. Googletrans supports over 100 
languages. In this project, it is used to translate the recognized English text 
into regional languages.
4. gTTS: gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech) is a Python library that allows 
developers to generate speech from text using Google's text-to-speech API. 
gTTS supports several languages and provides a simple and easy-to-use 
interface for generating speech from text. It is used to generate audio for the 
translated text.
5. Spacy: Spacy is an open-source NLP library for Python that provides a 
range of NLP capabilities such as named entity recognition, part-of-speech 
tagging, dependency parsing, and more. Spacy is designed to be fast, 
efficient, and easy to use. 
6. NLTK: NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) is a popular open-source NLP 
library for Python. It provides a range of NLP capabilities such as 
16
tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, part-of-speech tagging, and more. 
NLTK is widely used in research and academia and provides a large 
collection of corpora, lexical resources, and datasets.
